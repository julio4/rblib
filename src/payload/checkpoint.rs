/// Checkpoints represent an atomic incremental change in the payload building
/// process.
///
/// Notes:
///  - There is no public API to create a checkpoint directly. Checkpoints are
///    created from the [`BlockContext`] when it starts a new payload building
///    process or by mutations applied to an already existing checkpoint.
///
///  - Checkpoints contain all the information needed to assemble a full block
///    payload. However, they cannot be used directly to assemble a block. The
///    block assembly process is very node-specific and is part of the pipelines
///    api, which has more info and access to the underlying node facilities.
///
///  - Checkpoints are immutable, meaning that once a checkpoint is created, it
///    cannot be changed. Instead, new checkpoints can be created on top of the
///    existing ones, forming a chain of checkpoints.
///
///  - Checkpoints may represent forks in the payload building process. Two
///    checkpoints can share a common ancestor without having a linear history
///    between them. Each of the diverging checkpoints can be used to build
///    alternative versions of the payload.
///
///  - Checkpoints are inexpensive to clone, discard and move around. However,
///    they are expensive to create, as they require executing transactions
///    through the EVM and storing the resulting state changes.
///
///  - Checkpoints are thread-safe, Send + Sync + 'static.
///
///  - Checkpoints are always in a state that can be used to build a valid block
///    payload. You can't create checkpoints with invalid transactions (such as
///    invalid nonces, invalid signatures, etc.) that would invalidate the block
///    payload validity according to consensus rules.
///
///  - Checkpoints are state providers, meaning that any checkpoint can be used
///    as a database reference in an input to an EVM instance when simulating
///    transactions. The state of the checkpoint is the cumulative state of all
///    state mutations applied since the beginning of the block payload,
///    including the base state of the parent block of the block for which the
